    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which algorithm achieves the best level of compression on each file type?\n",
    "- for zeros_100p, bzip2 was the best, and in other files (7) , ArithmeticCompress was dominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which algorithm is the fastest?\n",
    "- for nt, bzip2 was the best, and in other 7 files, pbzip2 was dominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the difference between bzip2 and pbzip2? Do you expect one to be faster and why?\n",
    "- pbzip2 should be faster because it supports parallel computing in multi-core CPU. Therefore, the time difference shown in our result means that our server is operated with multi-core CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does the level of compression change as the percentage of zeros increases? Why does this happen?\n",
    "- As the precentages of zeros goes down(100->50) , the % compression decreases, because the algorithm works more effectively when there are more repetitive sequences. Therefore when there are 50% zeros, there are less repetitive sequences compared to 90 or 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the minimum number of bits required to store a single DNA base?\n",
    "- by Shannon's theory of information, the bits required = log2(4) = 2 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the minimum number of bits required to store an amino acid letter?\n",
    "- by Shannon's theory of information, the bits required = log2(20) = 4.32 -> 5 bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### In your tests, how many bits did gzip and bzip2 actually require to store your random DNA and protein sequences?\n",
    "- theoretically, DNA sequence should be 2500kb and Protein sequence should be 6250kb.\n",
    "- But in reality, DNA gzip/bzip2 required 293kb, 274kb, and Protein gzip/zip2 required 606kb, 553kb\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are gzip and bzip2 performing well on DNA and proteins?\n",
    "- for DNA, around 70% was compressed, and for Protein around 40% was compressed. So we guess the algoritms work well on DNA and proteins.\n"
